# Permutations
For Bobble.ai Internship Challenge. 
Given an array of arrays, it returns a list of strings, each representing a way to choose one element from each row. In my implementation it sorts the strings alphabetically.
## Running:
- First mark the file as executable using chmod and run "./permutations.py filename.csv". 
- Alternatively run "python3 ./permutations.py filename.csv" 
- Relative or absolute paths from your CWD (not necessarily where the file is stored) for the CSV file should work
